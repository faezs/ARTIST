# Stage 3: the pneumatic mount

The brief of 2026-09-05: a water hose for the frame, actuated like a vine robot so setup and tracking are
automatic; the structural dual of Hashemi's machine, the assembly below the primary like a flower; fractal, the
same stem and skin at every scale. The machine it applies to is the Cassegrain-receiver Hashemi machine on
nix-support (f 4.05, orbit 4 m about F, hyperboloid strip, vertical beam to the ellipsoid M4).

- `hashemi_pneumatic/memo_hp.md`: the mount as a freedom, actuation and constraint topology (Hopkins 2010):
  freedom space the sphere of rotations about F; constraints four wires through F from an outrigger ring
  (Hashemi's near method puts F on the focal tube through the slot); actuation by pure couples from a flexing
  water-filled stem, plus four pretensioned tendons routed by a clearance solver in the DCM paper's style.
  Checked over 59 Quetta sun positions at 9 and 25 m/s; stays deployed in the survival wind.
- `hashemi_pneumatic/screw_mount.py`: rank and reciprocity checks, unilateral statics, TWSM stiffness,
  actuation space, clearances; `tendon_solver.py`: the line enumeration; `water_stem.py`; `physics_hp.py`
  (sweep, root); `model_hp2.py`: CadQuery scenes; `model_hp.py`, `physics_hp.py`'s rod concept: superseded
  (a compression rod from the deck and hand-routed tendons; its sheets `hp_*` remain).
- register sheets 28-31.
- `flower/`: the first reading of the brief as a self-contained sunflower with a Cassegrain head and the beam
  down its own stem. Superseded: it redesigned the optics, which is the other fork's, and its secondary
  shadow was the wrong turn. Kept for the inflated-hose scale law and the hose sizing.
